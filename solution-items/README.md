# Notely

A Clean Architecture Template for a Modern Blazor WebAssembly Note-Taking App

---

## About the Project ⚡

Notely is a lightweight, modular, and scalable note-taking app built on top of **.NET 10** and **Blazor WebAssembly**. The architecture is designed to support clean separation of concerns, easy feature expansion, and a future-ready path for server-side APIs, offline mode, and synchronization.

**Notely focuses on delivering:**

- A fast and frictionless user experience  
- A clean modular codebase  
- Extensibility for future features such as tags, authentication, sync services, and personalization
